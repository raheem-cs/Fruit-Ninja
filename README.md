Created:  May-2018\
Released: August-2018

#### Build:
You can build this program on any IDE, i used NetBeans to build current one in this repository.

#### Support:
I will not be able to fix/update this game anymore as there is no time. So in case you found any problem try fix it yourself.

#### EXE:
Download: [Fruit Ninja.exe](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1hnapov9mvv4evl/Fruit%20Ninja.exe?dl=1 "Fruit Ninja.exe")\
Make sure [JVM](https://java.com/en/download/ "JVM") installed on your device so this exe works.\
I used [Launch4j](https://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/ "Launch4j") to generate this EXE.

#### How to Play?

Simply drag your mouse and enter to the fruit, avoid cutting bombs.

#### Setting Score File:
Go to C:\ and create new text file with name: Scores.txt, so scores works.
